<h1> Welcome to my goober profile</h1>

My current active projects are:

  - Currently barely usable, this fork of netradiant-custom provides a compiler for respawn source ( Titanfall 1, Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends season 3 ) games.
- [ServerUtilities](https://github.com/F1F7Y/ServerUtilities)
  - A server-side chat-commands based mod providing basic community features and an extensive API to server hosters hosting using the [Titanfall 2 Northstar Client](https://github.com/R2Northstar).
